# BHOOMISCAN: ULTIMATE CONTENT STRATEGY & CLAUDE PROJECT BLUEPRINT
## 20 Reels/Week Production System with 4-Pillar AI Script Generation

---

# PART 1: FOUR PILLARS — DEEP ANALYSIS & RATINGS

---

## PILLAR 1: Conversational Script Engineering Manual
**Rating: 9.5/10 — THE ENGINE**

**What it does brilliantly:**
- 12 hook archetypes with rotation rules — this alone prevents 80% of content staleness
- 6-beat energy arc (Hook → Setup → Body → Summary Punch → CTA → Close) gives every script a cinematic structure
- Conversational Texture Toolkit (Section 7) with energy boosters, affirmation words, colloquialisms, rhetorical questions, analogies, humor types — this is the secret sauce that makes AI scripts sound human
- Hinglish Calibration System prevents the #1 AI failure: unnatural language mixing
- Batch generation rules (Section 11) already anticipate repetition problems
- Sentence rhythm rules (3-1-3 pattern, one-word reveals, rapid fire Q&A) create the spoken-word feel that keeps viewers watching

**What's missing at 20/week volume:**
- 12 hook archetypes across 20 scripts/week = each archetype used 1.6x/week. This is tight but manageable with sub-variations
- Energy distribution guidance is for batches of 7, not 20 — needs scaling (addressed in this strategy)
- No content FORMAT variation guidance (all scripts assume single-speaker talking-head — needs expansion to listicles, myth-busters, story formats)

**Role in the system:** This is the HOW. Every script passes through this engine. It should be loaded FIRST in the Claude project because it controls output quality at the sentence level.

**Weightage: 35%** — Highest priority. Bad execution kills even great ideas.

---

## PILLAR 2: Brand Guide v2
**Rating: 9/10 — THE GUARDRAIL**

**What it does brilliantly:**
- Absolute clarity on what BhoomiScan IS and IS NOT — prevents the catastrophic error of inventing features
- NEVER/ALWAYS/CAN SAY rules per audience type — eliminates guesswork
- 4 USPs with "Natural → Better → Best" phrasing tiers — the model can pick quality level per context
- Trust Spectrum (Too Humble ↔ Sweet Spot ↔ Too Aggressive) — prevents both under-selling and over-promising
- Competitor positioning done right: reference category, never name competitors
- Verification badge handling at Light/Medium/Full mention levels
- CTA accuracy rules prevent the fatal mistake of saying "download the app"

**What's missing at 20/week volume:**
- USP rotation is designed for batches of 7, not 20 — needs weekly rotation matrix
- No guidance on how to handle the same USP across different audience types in the same week
- Geographic reference rules could be more detailed for content that targets specific Odisha localities

**Role in the system:** This is the WHAT and the BOUNDARIES. Every script is validated against this. It should be loaded SECOND because it constrains what the engine can produce.

**Weightage: 25%** — Second highest. Accuracy errors destroy trust faster than bad writing.

---

## PILLAR 3: Target Audience Guide
**Rating: 8.5/10 — THE COMPASS**

**What it does brilliantly:**
- Three fully realized persona cards with demographics, psychographics, pain points in their actual voice
- 18 script-ready insights with pre-written hook angles — massive time saver
- Language calibration per audience (Buyer: 65% Hindi, Agent: 55% Hindi) — prevents one-size-fits-all
- 18-item objection handling library with ready responses — scripts can pre-handle resistance
- 25 script-ready stats in Hinglish — drop directly into hooks
- Content strategy takeaways with posting times, format guidance, topic winners

**What's missing at 20/week volume:**
- NRI audience is mentioned in stats but doesn't have a full persona card (only 3 objections in Section 4)
- No sub-segmentation within personas (e.g., inherited land seller vs. investor seller have very different emotional triggers)
- Stat library is static — needs weekly refresh protocol for freshness
- No seasonal/festival overlay for Indian calendar events

**Role in the system:** This is the WHO and WHY. It determines which audience each script targets, what emotional register to use, and what objections to pre-handle. Loaded THIRD.

**Weightage: 25%** — Equal to Brand Guide. Knowing your audience is as important as knowing your product.

---

## PILLAR 4: Scripts 12-21 v3 (Reference Scripts)
**Rating: 8/10 — THE BENCHMARK**

**What it does brilliantly:**
- 10 fully executed scripts showing the system in action — the model learns by example
- Covers all 3 audiences (Buyers: 16, 17, 18; Sellers: 12, 17, 19; Agents: 13, 14, 15)
- Demonstrates hook variety (Confession, Knowledge Gap, Single Number, Story Entry, Situational, Scene Setter, Common Mistake, Audience Question, Future Frame, Social Proof)
- Shows CTA integration patterns working naturally in context
- Caption and hashtag formatting is production-ready

**What's missing at 20/week volume:**
- Only 10 reference scripts — at 20/week this set will be "learned" in half a week, risking pattern mimicry
- No NRI-focused reference script
- No trending/seasonal reference script
- No data-backed/research-driven reference script
- All scripts are talking-head format — no format variation examples

**Role in the system:** This is the STANDARD. The model uses these as quality benchmarks, not templates to copy. Loaded LAST (as few-shot examples, not primary instructions).

**Weightage: 15%** — Lowest among pillars. Examples guide quality but shouldn't constrain creativity.

---

# PART 4: ROTATION SYSTEMS

---

## 4.1 HOOK ARCHETYPE ROTATION (20 Scripts/Week)

The manual has 12 archetypes. With 20 scripts/week, each archetype gets used ~1.7 times. The rule: **never use the same archetype in the same day, and never use it for the same audience twice in a row across weeks.**

### Weekly Hook Allocation Matrix

| Week Pattern | Mon (3) | Tue (3) | Wed (3) | Thu (3) | Fri (3) | Sat (3) | Sun (2) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Week A** | Confession, Knowledge Gap, Bold Claim | Single Number, Story Entry, Rhetorical | Situational, Scene Setter, Common Mistake | Audience Question, Future Frame, Confession | Social Proof, Knowledge Gap, Scene Setter | Bold Claim, Single Number, Story Entry | Common Mistake, Situational |
| **Week B** | Story Entry, Scene Setter, Social Proof | Common Mistake, Future Frame, Bold Claim | Confession, Rhetorical, Audience Question | Knowledge Gap, Situational, Single Number | Scene Setter, Story Entry, Confession | Future Frame, Common Mistake, Rhetorical | Bold Claim, Social Proof |

**Alternate Week A and Week B patterns. After 2 weeks, create Week C and Week D by shifting the matrix.**

---

## 4.2 AUDIENCE ROTATION (Preventing Audience Fatigue)

Each audience sees content through 4 emotional lenses that cycle weekly:

| Week | Buyer Lens | Seller Lens | Agent Lens | NRI Lens |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Week 1** | Fear → Safety | Frustration → Control | Anxiety → Growth | Distance → Connection |
| **Week 2** | Confusion → Clarity | Invisibility → Visibility | Irrelevance → Relevance | Distrust → Verification |
| **Week 3** | Overwhelm → Simplicity | Commission Pain → Savings | Competition → Advantage | Complexity → Ease |
| **Week 4** | Distrust → Confidence | Time Waste → Efficiency | Digital Fear → Digital Power | Emotional → Practical |

**After 4 weeks, the cycle resets with new specific angles within each emotional pair.**

---

## 4.3 ENERGY DISTRIBUTION (20 Scripts/Week)

The manual's guidance for 7 scripts scales to 20:

| Energy Level | Scripts/Week | % | When to Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| **HIGH** (8-9/10) | 5 | 25% | Predictions, challenges, shocking stats, bold claims |
| **MEDIUM** (5-7/10) | 10 | 50% | Educational, tips, practical how-tos, step-by-step |
| **WARM** (4-6/10) | 5 | 25% | Community, Q&A, relatable stories, personal philosophy |

### Energy Placement Across the Week:
- **Monday:** MEDIUM, HIGH, MEDIUM
- **Tuesday:** HIGH, MEDIUM, WARM
- **Wednesday:** MEDIUM, HIGH, MEDIUM
- **Thursday:** MEDIUM, MEDIUM, WARM
- **Friday:** HIGH, MEDIUM, HIGH
- **Saturday:** WARM, HIGH, MEDIUM
- **Sunday:** WARM, MEDIUM

**Friday and Saturday get higher energy concentration** — weekend content needs to compete harder for attention.

---

## 4.4 PAIN POINT CYCLING (5 Core × 3 Audiences = 15 Angles)

### Master Pain Point Matrix

| Pain Point | Buyer Angle | Seller Angle | Agent Angle |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Trust Deficit** | "Yeh genuine hai ya fraud?" | "Buyer serious hai ya time waste?" | "Client kehta hai online pe sab milta hai" |
| **2. Commission Drain** | "Broker 2% maang raha hai" | "₹1 lakh broker ko kyun doon?" | "Margin kam hota ja raha hai" |
| **3. Document Chaos** | "Kaunse documents check karein?" | "Documents ready nahi hain" | "Client ke documents incomplete hain" |
| **4. Spam/Time-Wasters** | "Fake listings se thak gaya" | "50 spam calls, zero serious buyers" | "70% leads bekaar hote hain" |
| **5. Digital Illiteracy** | "Online pe kaise bharosa karein?" | "Tech nahi aata, complicated hoga" | "Digital marketing kahan se shuru karein?" |

### 4-Week Pain Point Cycling Calendar:

| Week | Featured Pain Points (Primary focus, 2-3 per week) |
|---|---|
| **Week 1** | Trust Deficit (3 reels) + Commission Drain (2 reels) |
| **Week 2** | Document Chaos (3 reels) + Spam/Time-Wasters (2 reels) |
| **Week 3** | Digital Illiteracy (3 reels) + Trust Deficit (2 reels) |
| **Week 4** | Commission Drain (3 reels) + Document Chaos (2 reels) |

**The remaining 15 reels/week cover other pain points secondarily.** This ensures each core pain point gets concentrated attention every month while staying present throughout.

---

## 4.5 USP ROTATION (Scaled from 7 to 20 Scripts)

| USP | Reels/Week | Primary Mention | Secondary/Subtle Mention |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Free Listings** | 10 | 5 (headline USP) | 5 (mentioned in CTA) |
| **WhatsApp Connect** | 9 | 4 (headline USP) | 5 (mentioned in CTA) |
| **Verified Properties** | 7 | 3 (headline USP) | 4 (badge mention in context) |
| **Zero Commission** | 7 | 3 (headline USP) | 4 (contrast with broker model) |

**Rule: No script features more than 2 USPs prominently. Each script has 1 primary USP and may reference 1 secondary USP in the CTA.**

---

## 4.6 CTA PATTERN ROTATION (6 Patterns Across 20 Scripts)

| CTA Pattern | Usage/Week | Best For |
|---|---|---|
| Casual Aside ("Aur haan,") | 4 | Educational content |
| Logical Extension ("Aur ek baat,") | 3 | Tip-based content |
| Reassurance Bridge ("Aur dekho,") | 3 | Fear/pain content |
| Conditional ("Agar...toh") | 4 | Audience-specific content |
| Process Integration ("[Steps]...aur [CTA]") | 3 | How-to content |
| Platform-as-Solution ("Toh [CTA]") | 3 | Problem-solution content |

---

## 4.7 SEASONAL/FESTIVAL HOOKS — Indian Calendar Integration

### Major Hooks (Create dedicated reel):

| Month | Festival/Event | Script Angle |
|---|---|---|
| **January** | New Year, Makar Sankranti | "Naye saal mein zameen invest karo — resolution worth keeping" |

| **March** | Holi, Financial Year End | "March mein property khareedna tax-smart move kyun hai" |
| **April** | New Financial Year, Akshaya Tritiya, Ram Navami | "Akshaya Tritiya pe zameen khareedna — tradition meets smart investing" |
| **May** | Summer/Wedding Season | "Shaadi ke baad pehla investment — flat ya zameen?" |
| **June** | Monsoon Start | "Barish se pehle yeh 3 cheezein check karo plot mein" |
| **July** | Rath Yatra (Odisha) | "Odisha mein zameen ka scene — Rath Yatra special" |
| **August** | Independence Day, Raksha Bandhan | "Azaadi broker se — direct selling ka power" |
| **September** | Ganesh Chaturthi, Navratri Start | "Shubh muhurat mein property register karwao — but pehle yeh karo" |

| **November** | Diwali, Bhai Dooj, Kartik Purnima | "Diwali pe zameen ka saudha — 5 rules follow karo" |
| **December** | Christmas, Year-End | "2026 land market ka review — kya seekha, kya karna hai 2027 mein" |

### Micro-Hooks (Weave into existing scripts):
- **Exam results season** (May-June): "Result aaye, ab investment ki padhai karo"
- **Transfer season** (April-June): "Transfer ho gaya? Naye sheher mein plot lene se pehle..."
- **NRI visit season** (Dec-Jan): "India aaye ho? Hometown mein zameen ka scene check karo"
- **Monsoon** (June-Sept): "Barish mein zameen dekhne mat jao — yeh 3 mistakes hoti hain"
- **Dhanteras/Diwali** (Oct-Nov): "Gold loge ya zameen? Math karo — zameen 123% badhti hai 3 saal mein"

---

## 4.8 CONTENT FORMAT ROTATION (Beyond Talking Head)

| Format | Reels/Week | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Talking Head (Standard)** | 10 | Classic single-speaker, educational |
| **Myth Buster** | 3 | "Myth: [wrong belief]. Reality: [truth]" structure |
| **Number Shock** | 2 | Open with one shocking stat, unpack it |
| **Story-Based** | 2 | Third-person narrative ("Ek seller ne...") |
| **Rapid Fire** | 1 | "5 things in 30 seconds" high-energy format |
| **Q&A Response** | 1 | Answer a real/planted audience question |
| **Prediction/Future** | 1 | "2026-2030 mein yeh hoga" forward-looking |

---

# PART 5: VARIATION ENGINE — FRESH CONTENT SYSTEM

---

## 5.1 Weekly Deep Research Protocol (Claude Deep Research)

**Every Sunday evening or Monday morning, run ONE deep research session to generate fresh data for the week.**

### Research Prompt Template:
```
Search for the latest news, data, and developments in Indian land market, 
real estate regulations, property technology, RERA updates, state-wise land 
digitization, NRI investment rules, and land fraud cases from the past 7 days. 
Focus on: Odisha real estate developments, Indian property market trends, 
new government policies affecting land, notable land scam cases in news, 
PropTech funding/launches, and any changes to stamp duty or registration rules.
```

### How to Use Research Output:
- Extract 3-5 fresh data points → Feed into Prompt 4 (Trending scripts)
- Extract 1-2 news hooks → Convert to "Did you know?" openers
- Extract regulatory changes → Create urgent awareness reels
- Extract scam cases → Anonymize and use as cautionary story scripts

### Research-to-Script Pipeline:
1. Deep Research output → Extract 5 usable insights
2. Tag each insight: [BUYER] [SELLER] [AGENT] [NRI] [ALL]
3. Assign to appropriate prompt slot
4. Model weaves fresh data into script hooks and proof points

---

## 5.3 Freshness Multiplier System

Even with the same angle, content stays fresh through these multipliers:

| Multiplier | How it Works | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Swap** | Same topic, new stat from weekly research | "66% civil cases" → fresh stat from last week's news |
| **Story Swap** | Same lesson, new anonymized story | Different scam scenario, same "verify before buying" lesson |
| **Hook Swap** | Same content, different opening archetype | Confession hook → Number Shock hook on same topic |
| **Audience Swap** | Same insight, different audience lens | "Documents matter" for buyers vs. sellers vs. agents |
| **Format Swap** | Same topic, different content format | Talking head → Myth Buster on same topic |
| **Seasonal Overlay** | Same evergreen topic + timely context | "Before buying land" + "monsoon season special" |
| **Objection Anchor** | Same topic, led by different objection | "Online pe bharosa kaise?" vs "Free hai toh catch kya?" |
| **Geographic Lens** | Same insight, localized | Pan-India angle → Odisha-specific data layered in |

**With 13 angles × 8 multipliers = 104 unique combinations per audience before any angle repeats identically.**

---

## 5.4 Script Differentiation Checklist (Run Before Finalizing Each Batch)

Before approving any batch of 5 scripts, verify:
- [ ] No two scripts open with the same hook archetype
- [ ] No two scripts target the same pain point as primary focus
- [ ] No two scripts feature the same USP as primary mention
- [ ] Energy levels are distributed (not all MEDIUM or all HIGH)
- [ ] At least 1 script uses a stat/data point NOT used in the previous week
- [ ] At least 1 script contains a seasonal/timely reference
- [ ] CTA patterns are different across all 5 scripts
- [ ] Bio link phrasing is different across all 5 scripts
- [ ] Self-referential moments appear in only 1-2 out of 5 scripts
- [ ] Closing triggers are mixed (save, share, comment, follow)

---

# PART 6: WHAT WAS MISSING — ADDITIONS

---

## 6.1 Competitive Intelligence Integration

From the competitive analysis, these angles are GOLD for scripts and were not in the original 4 pillars:

**Script-Ready Competitive Insights:**
1. "99acres pe 1.3/5 rating hai Trustpilot pe. Log pareshan hain fake listings se." → Don't name them, use: "Bade portals pe 1.3 rating hai — log thak gaye hain."
2. "Kisi bhi bade portal pe land ownership verify nahi hoti listing se pehle." → "Doosri jagah listing daalo — koi verify nahi karta. BhoomiScan pe Khata se verify hota hai."
3. "MagicBricks pe agricultural land ko 'ZERO marks' mila review mein." → "Bade platforms zameen ko seriously lete hi nahi. Unka focus apartments pe hai."
4. "NoBroker Bhubaneswar mein kaam hi nahi karta." → "Bade platforms abhi Odisha mein hain hi nahi."
5. "99acres ka BOSS model — seller ka number 5 agents ko share hota hai." → "Doosri jagah tumhara number 5 logon ko bik jaata hai."

## 6.2 A/B Testing Framework

For each prompt batch, generate 2 alternative hooks for the first script. Track which performs better on Instagram Insights. After 4 weeks, you'll have data on which hook archetypes work best for your specific audience.

**Weekly A/B Protocol:**
- Monday's first reel: Create 2 versions with different hooks
- Post Version A on Instagram, Version B saved as backup
- If Version A underperforms (<50% of average views by 24 hours), swap to Version B
- Log results: Hook Archetype | Audience | Views | Saves | Shares

## 6.3 Content Recycling Strategy

At 20/week = 80/month = 960/year. High-performing content can be recycled:

- **30-Day Recycle:** Same insight, completely new script (different hook, different examples)
- **60-Day Recycle:** Same hook angle, updated with fresh data
- **90-Day Recycle:** Best performing scripts can be re-posted (Instagram algorithm favors this for new followers)

## 6.4 Engagement Trigger Distribution (20 Scripts/Week)

| Trigger | Scripts/Week | Best Content Type |
|---|---|---|
| **SAVE** | 8 | Educational, checklists, guides |
| **SHARE** | 4 | Scam awareness, family-relevant, shocking stats |
| **COMMENT** | 4 | Debates, opinions, Q&A, "kya prefer karte ho?" |
| **FOLLOW** | 4 | Series content, weekly tips, transformation stories |

Before writing anything, identify the target audience from the prompt.
Pull the persona card. Note their emotional state, pain points in their 
own voice, language calibration (Hindi-English ratio), and tone register.
Select 1-2 stats from Section 6 as potential hooks or proof points.
Identify which objection to pre-handle inside the script.

STEP 2 — GUARDRAIL (Brand Guide v2, 25% weight):
Validate what you CAN and CANNOT say for this audience. Check the 
NEVER/ALWAYS/CAN SAY rules. Select 1 primary USP to weave in. Verify 
CTA phrasing matches the audience type. Confirm no invented features, 
no overclaiming, no competitor naming.

STEP 3 — ENGINE (Script Engineering Manual, 35% weight):
Now write. Select hook archetype (must differ from the previous script 
in this batch). Follow the 6-beat energy arc. Apply conversational 
texture (5-8 elements per script). Use correct pronoun system 
(tum/tumhare, never aap, never tu). Calibrate Hinglish per the rules.
Apply sentence rhythm (3-1-3 pattern, short punches). Weave CTA 
naturally using one of the 6 patterns. Close with appropriate 
engagement trigger matching the content type.

STEP 4 — BENCHMARK (Reference Scripts, 15% weight):
Compare your output quality against the reference scripts. Does it 
sound as natural? Is the tone as warm? Is the pacing as varied? If 
any line sounds like AI, rewrite it.

ABSOLUTE RULES (NEVER VIOLATE)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PLATFORM ACCURACY:

- NEVER claim scale ("hazaaron listings", "India ka sabse bada")
- NEVER name competitors (99acres, MagicBricks, Housing.com, NoBroker)

# PART 10: PERFORMANCE TRACKING TEMPLATE

---

## Weekly Script Performance Log

| Script # | Day | Audience | Hook Type | Views (24h) | Saves | Shares | Comments | Best/Worst |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mon | Buyer | Confession | | | | | |
| 2 | Mon | Seller | Scene Setter | | | | | |
| ... | ... | ... | ... | | | | | |
| 20 | Sun | Mixed | Social Proof | | | | | |

### Monthly Analysis Questions:
1. Which hook archetype gets the highest average views?
2. Which audience type gets the most saves?
3. Which pain point topic gets the most shares?
4. Which USP mention drives the most profile visits?
5. Which posting time performs best?

**Use these insights to adjust the next month's prompt parameters — increase what works, reduce what doesn't.**

---

## FINAL NOTES

### What This System Achieves:
- **104+ unique content angles per audience** before ANY repetition (13 angles × 8 multipliers)
- **Systematic freshness** through weekly deep research feeding into Prompt 4
- **Consistent quality** through the 4-pillar validation hierarchy
- **Natural variation** through mandatory rotation of hooks, CTAs, bio links, energy, USPs, pain points
- **Production speed** of 20 scripts in ~2.5 hours weekly
- **Built-in improvement** through cleanup prompts and performance tracking

### The Competitive Moat:
No competitor in the Indian land market is producing this volume of targeted, persona-specific, data-backed Hinglish content. At 20 reels/week, BhoomiScan will have produced 1,040 reels in the first year — building an SEO and social media presence that becomes exponentially harder for competitors to replicate.
